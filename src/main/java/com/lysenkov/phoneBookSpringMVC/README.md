Create Spring MVC Maven project.

Take PhoneBook application as an example and create Spring MVC (REST) application as follow:

GET - receive all phoneBook records

GET/{name} - all phones for the given name

PUT/{name}; phoneNumber - add phone to existing name

POST/; {“name”:”YourName”, “phoneNumber”: “+79998887711”} - create a new record in the phoneBook

DELETE/{name} - removes record by name completely (including associated phone numbers).

Rest resources must be located under api/v1/contacts.

Use JSON as a request/response body.

All records can be kept in memory.

DELETE/{name} - must throw an exception if there is no such phone in the
PhoneBook. Exception must be handled and reason must be printed out as a JSON object.
Ensure that appropriate HTTP status codes are returned for ALL methods.

Java configuration of Spring MVC is a must.

To run this application:
1. Connect DB Postgres on port 5433
2. Run main method
3. Open Postman

Make GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests

url: http://localhost:8080/api/v1/contacts/

body:
{
"name":"name",
"phoneNumber":["number"]
}
